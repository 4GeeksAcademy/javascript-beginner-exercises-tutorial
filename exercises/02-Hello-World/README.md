# `02` Hello World

In JavaScript, we use `console.log()` to make the computer print anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called the `console`.

Every language has a `console`, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows or MacOS arrived). 

Today, printing to the `console` is mainly used as a monitoring tool, ideally to leave a trace of the content of variables during execution of a program.

This is an example of how to use it:

```js
console.log('How are you?');
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use `console.log()` to print `Hello World` on the console. 

Feel free to try other things as well!
