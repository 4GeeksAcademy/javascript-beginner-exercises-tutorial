# `03` Multiply Two Values

Programming languages, such as Javascript, allow for basic math operations (multiplication, division, etc.) to be performed on expressions.

To multiply two values in Javascript, use the asterisk (*) operator like this:

```js
let resultingValue = 2 * 3;
```

In this instance, we stored the product of `2 * 3` into a variable called `resultingValue`.

## 📝  Instructions:

1. Store the product of 2345 times 7323 in a variable called `variablesAreCool`.

2. Print the result to the console.
