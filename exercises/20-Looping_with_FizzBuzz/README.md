# `20` Looping with FizzBuzz

This is a typical beginner test that is required to complete interviews in Google, Facebook and all other big tech unicorns.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write the code needed to print to the console all the numbers from `1` to `100`. 

2. For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print `Fizz`.

3. For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`. 

4. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

## Example output:

```js
/

2  
Fizz  
4  
Buzz  
Fizz  
7  
8  
Fizz
