The other cool thing about variables is that you don't need to know their value to be able to work with them.

For example, the application right now is prompting the user for its age, and then printing it on the console.

Instructions
Please add 10 years to the value of the age variable.
The content of the variable its being previously filled with whatever the user inputs.
