As you know, functions are a useful block of code that you can re-use as many times as you need or want. In the last exercise, you had a function that received two parameters (two inputs) and returned the sum of those. Like this:

function addNumbers(a, b){
  return a + b;
}

But Javascript comes with a bunch of "pre defined" functions that you can use, for example:

Math.random();

You can use the Math.random() function to get a random decimal number between 0 and 1, every time you call that function it will return another random decimal number between 0 and 1.

Instructions: 
Please now create a function called generateRandom that generates a random number between 0 and 9 every time it is called.

Hint: 
- One possible solution involves using two predefined functions: the Math.random and Math.floor functions.
