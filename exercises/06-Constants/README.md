# `06` Constants


Since 2015, JavaScript has allowed the use of constants. 
Constants differ from variables because once declared, they cannot have their values changed over time (unlike variables).

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word **const** instead of **var**, like this:

```js
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

Constants are extremely useful. As a developer you may want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.


## :pencil: Instructions
* Run the exercise and fix the error that is shown on the console. 
* Make the code output **0.9** on the console when fixed.

### 💡 Hint:
* Search "TypeError assignment to constant variable" on Google.com to learn how to fix it.
