Since 2015, Javascript also allows the usage of constants, they differ from variables because once declared, they cannot change their value over time like variables can.

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word const instead of var, like this:

const VERSION = '1.2';

Constants are super useful because some times, as a developer, you want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.
